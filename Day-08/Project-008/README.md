In this project, I have shown how to make Caesar Cipher in which we encode and decode the message(input) entered by the user. To encode the message, I have used the concept of shifting alphabets in the message, which was used in ancient time by Julius Ceasar during the wars to send hidden messages to their secret agents. 

User is asked to enter the message along with the number shifts they want the message to be encoded with. In the same way, while decoding a message the user is asked to enter the encrypted messsage and the number of shifts they want the message to be decoded with.
