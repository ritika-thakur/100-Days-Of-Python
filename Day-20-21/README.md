# Snake Game

The project is divided into two days(day 20-21), in this project I have created the famous snake game which almost all of us have played in our mobile phones. The game has been created using the turtle library. Concepts of Object oriented programming has been heavily used in this project.

Tasks divided for each day are: 


## Day 20

1. Create Snake
2. Move Snake
3. Control Snake


## Day 21

1. Detect collision with food
2. Create a scoreboard
3. Detect collision with wall
4. Detect collision with tail.


After completion the game should look something like the gif below.
