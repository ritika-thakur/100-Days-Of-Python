# Higher or Lower

In project, I have created a game in which the user has to guess which Celebrity has more followers on instagram. Based on the already stored data the program compares the results and keeps count of the scores until the player lose. 

## Concepts: 

1. Functions
2. While loop
3. Nested dictionary
4. If-else

```
    __  ___       __             
   / / / (_)___ _/ /_  ___  _____
  / /_/ / / __ `/ __ \/ _ \/ ___/
 / __  / / /_/ / / / /  __/ /    
/_/ ///_/\__, /_/ /_/\___/_/     
   / /  /____/_      _____  _____
  / /   / __ \ | /| / / _ \/ ___/
 / /___/ /_/ / |/ |/ /  __/ /    
/_____/\____/|__/|__/\___/_/     

Compare A: 


 _    __    
| |  / /____
| | / / ___/
| |/ (__  ) 
|___/____(_)

Against B:
