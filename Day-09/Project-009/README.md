Secret auction is a type on auction in which people bid secretly and the person with the highest bid wins. Using a dictinary the bid made by the user is collected. To keep the auction secretive, a library of replit is used to clear the interface after the user is done entering the information. Winner of the auction is announced once all the people are done bidding.
