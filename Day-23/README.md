# Turtle Crossing Game
In this project, I have created a game in which the player has to help the turtle to cross the road. With each level the speed of the cars will increase. 

## Steps

To create the turtle crossing game, the game has been divided into the following tasks and then programmed.

1. Move the turtle with keypress
2. Create and move the cars
3. Detect collision with car
4. Detect when the turtle reaches the other side
5. Create a scoreboard
