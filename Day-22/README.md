# Pong Game

In today's project I have made a pong game using turtle library. Object oriented programming has been heavily used.
Go ahead and try playing the game yourself with your friends.


## Steps 

The game has been coded after being divided into the following task.

1. Create the screen
2. Create move a paddle
3. Create another paddle
4. Create the ball and make it move
5. Detect collision with wall and bounce
6. Detect collision with paddle
7. Detect when paddle misses
8. Keep score

The output of the code should be something like the gif below.
